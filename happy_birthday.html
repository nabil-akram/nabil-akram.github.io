         <h2 class="text">HAPPY 24th BIRTHDAY!</h2>
         <p class="para">May all your wishes come true. Live your life to the fullest and don't forget to smile
             and stay happy always. <br> Take good care of your health and eat a lot if you can haha. Whatever that you're going through, <br>
             I will be your number one fan and if you need a shoulder to cry on or anything that troubles you, know that you can always <br>
             reach out to me and I will try to do anything within my reach. Did you know that you are one hell of a person, <br>
             you're independent and also mature, plus if you want something, you will do it on your own and in your own way. <br>
             This proves that anything can be achieved if you try hard enough and pour all your heart into it. <br>
             Not many people can do what you did. You may not see this, but from my point of view, you really went through a lot <br>
             and you should be proud of yourself because of your past, you become the person you are today and that is one <br> 
             hell of an achievement. Another amazing thing about you is if you don't like something or someone, you really push it <br>
             aside and alienating anyone who you don't like haha. This tells you that you have a strong and firm personality,<br>
             you don't care what stands in your way, you just do what is right for you, and also you will always try to make yourself <br>
             happy in your own terms which is awesome because some find it hard to love and care for themselves.<br>
             You truly are an amazing person. Maybe you haven't heard this but I like you because of your personality,<br>
             all your flaws and imperfections, how strong you are facing problems on your own, surviving on your own, taking care <br>
             of yourself. Although we were just starting to get to know each other, I will try to be there for you and give my best to <br>
             support you in any way that I can, from listening to your problems, to lift you up whenever you are down. I might not be <br>
             your prince charming, but I can be your knight in shining armor, Maybe I'm not the one that you always wanted but I will try <br>
             to be the one that you need.<br>
             Happy birthday.
             <br>
