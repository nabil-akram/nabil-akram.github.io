        <h2 class="text">HAPPY 24th BIRTHDAY!</h2>
         <p class="para">May all your wishes come true. Live your life to the fullest and don't forget to smile
             and stay happy always. <br> Take good care of your health and eat a lot if you can haha. Whatever that you're going through, <br>
             I will be your number one fan and if you need a shoulder to cry on or anything that troubles you, know that you can always <br>
             reach out to me and I will try to do anything within my reach. Did you know that you are one hell of a person, <br>
             you're independent and also mature, plus if you want something, you will do it on your own and in your own way. <br>
             This proves that anything can be achieved if you try hard enough and pour all your heart into it. <br>
             Not many people can do what you did. You may not see this, but from other's point of view, you really went through a lot <br>
             and you should be proud of yourself because of your past experiences, you become the person you are today and that is one <br> 
             hell of an achievement. Another thing that I found interesting is if you don't like something or someone, you really push it <br>
             aside and palau anyone who you don't like haha. This tells you that you have a strong and firm personality, you don't care what <br>
             other's two cents are, you just do what is right for you, and also you will always try to make yourself happy but in your own <br>
             terms which is awesome because some people find it hard to love and care for themselves. You truly are an amazing person. <br>
             Although we just starting to get to know each other but I will try to be there for you if needed and I hope I can get to <br> 
             know you more! Enjoy your day!
             <br>
             <br>
             PS. Sorry kalau mende ni buat kamu rasa cringe haha if yes please let me know nnti in future tak buat dah haha.
